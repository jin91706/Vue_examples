This hot tub takes only a half hour to fill and four hours to heat. The jets are powerful; the tray is very handy and the seating arrangements are well thought out and non constricting. There is more than enough room for two people in this luxurious little spa. I chose this one over the Drift because you can just lay back and relax with room to spare.The LED lighting is just magical and the cost... using two to three times per day is only $25. Can. Per month. Also the Sahara Sand color actually has the look and texture of real sand. I just love this Fantasy Spa!",
